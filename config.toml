Since the early days of  the Knights, we have organized ourselves on what we call the "Battalion System." The way that the Battalion System works is that Knights self select a specific group inside of the order that they would like to be a part of, and report from that point on directly to the commander of that group. In the tabs below this one, there are descriptions of each of the battalions that may help you decide which one you would like to join. Battalions form a kind of small group where knights receive guidance, orders, and answers. Joining a battalion is an important part of staying involved in the events and better contributing to the cause.

[Read about each of our battalions](/battalions/).
